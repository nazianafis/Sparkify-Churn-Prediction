## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
Business need to retain their customers in order to thrive. Churn (the process of losing customers) is therefore an important business problem.

This project makes use of a tiny subset (~128MB) of the full dataset (~12GB), provided by Udacity, to practice machine learning. The goal is to assist a fictitious music streaming service 'Sparkify' in retaining its customers by predicting the tendency to churn even before they actually do it.
